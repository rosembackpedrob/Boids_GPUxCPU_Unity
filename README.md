# Boids in Unity
Built in the Digital Games degree at the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro

An implementation of the crowd/ flocking Boids algorithm model made in Unity and in two approaches: 
1. A sequential version made with C#;
2. A concurrent one implemented using Unity's Compute Shader, for a parallel updating in the GPU's SM's for each boid.
